Game of Life in Go
----------------------

This is a pretty weird split of functionality, with all of the Game of Life logic on the Go server side, and the display in Backbone / javascript client side.

That split doesn't make much sense since we're doing round trips to the server to get info which we could easily calculate client side, bit it was a good excuse to mess with Go and Backbone.js.
